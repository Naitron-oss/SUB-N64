Known problems as of v1.2:
---------------------------------------
 - OpenGL Combiner 1.4v2 - Mario Kart: blinking item boxes
 - OpenGL Combiner 1.4v2 - Mario Kart: missing/flashing player number at Player Select screen
 - OpenGL Combiner 1.4v2 - Mario Kart: black/faded option boxes at Game Select screen
 - OpenGL Combiner 1.4v2 - Mario Kart: glitches in radar
 - S.F. Rush - textures are not aligned correctly
 - Doesn't work on Via Unichrome chipset (combiner OGL 1.2/1.3)
 - Fog bug:
   - when polygons cross the near-Z clipping plane, they change to a solid white or gray color
   - fog is being miscalculated for very close polygons, and washing out the color
   - this can be seen in many parts (including the intro) of Zelda: OOT

Feature Requests:
-----------------
 - support widescreen resolutions with pillarboxing
