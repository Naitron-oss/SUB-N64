Mupen64Plus TODO:

Known problems as of v1.2:
---------------------------------------
 - GTK GUI: Fullscreen button / F11 doesn't toggle fullscreen with RiceVideo
 - GTK GUI: crashes if input plugin doesn't load, ie if SDL_ttf not found
   - poor error reporting: _nogui build does the right thing
 - glN64: Mario Kart w/ intel 855 - screen flickers black intermittently
 - Blight Input: doesn't recognize logitech dual action on Gentoo desktop PC [RG]
 - crash after running Asteroids Hyper 64 from GUI build 3 times in a row w/ 64-bit dynarec
 - Blight Input: Some games continuously register up-direction movement
 - If a ROM is highlighted when play button pressed, this ROM should be played
 - Blight Input: config dialog eats 100% CPU when open
 - Blight Input: Config interface depends on libSDL_ttf-2.0.so.0 which doesn't exist on all systems.
 - After loading a ROM and closing it / loading a ROM and restarting the emulator, the ROM appears
   as an invalid dump in the Good Name. You need to refresh the ROM list to reset it back to its
   normal Good Name


Feature Requests:
-----------------
 - cheat system
 - turn audio on/off to run at >100% speed to skip cut-scenes, loading, etc
   - Add fast-forward function similar to zsnes
 - Blight input: map special functions such as exit, fastforward, etc to controller buttons/keys
 - Blight Input: fake analog stick for controllers that don't have analog control sticks (walk/run)
 - Network play, including in-game voice chat
 - Blight Input: rumble and deadzone configuration
