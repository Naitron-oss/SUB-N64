  | Clarification:
  |
  |   The GNU Lesser General Public License or LGPL is written for
  |   software libraries in the first place. We expressly want the LGPL to
  |   be valid for this artwork library too.
  |
  |   KDE Oxygen theme icons is a special kind of software library, it is an
  |   artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical User Interface, or
  |   GUI.
  |
  |   Source code, for this library means:
  |    - where they exist, SVG;
  |    - otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered formats xcf or psd, or
  |   otherwise png.
  |
  |   The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
  |   notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.
  |
  |   With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the directory
  |   containing the elements. You may follow this practice.
  |
  |   The exception in section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License covers
  |   the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
