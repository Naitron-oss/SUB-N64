* Castlevania flames - caused by loading two textures with one loadblock, loads entire
  tmem, 512 qwords, which fills both textures, at 0x000 and 0x100.

* Add >256 texrect support - for mario kart and others, chopper attack not included (uses
  triangles)

* Add >256 tri support - shrink textures that are > 256, don't bother to split it unless
  it's a texrect

* Add odd-ratioed wrapping - objects CAN wrap at non-power-of-two places, see zappy jellyfish
  in Jabu-Jabu's belly (lightning texture), stretch these textures to a power of two so that
  wrapping can be successfully performed.
